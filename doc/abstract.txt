The Combinatorial Bioinformatic Meta-Framework (CBMF) addresses the challenges
posed by the rapid growth of next-generation sequencing technologies and the
resulting surge in biological data volume. This framework introduces a
collection of Linux shell scripts designed to streamline and standardize
bioinformatics workflows for high-throughput sequence analysis. CBMF leverages
the lightweight package manager micromamba to efficiently manage software
dependencies and installations, providing access to a comprehensive suite of
bioinformatics tools. The framework implements automated, reproducible workflows
for critical tasks such as quality control, alignment, assembly, and
quantification across various sequencing data types, including RNA-Seq,
ChIP-Seq, and whole-genome sequencing. By automating these
processes, CBMF ensures consistency, minimizes human error, and
enhances reproducibility in data processing. The modular design
allows researchers to select and customize tools for their
specific analyses, while detailed documentation and tutorials
make the framework accessible to users with varying levels of
computational expertise. CBMF represents a significant
advancement in making high-throughput sequencing data analysis
more manageable and accessible to the broader research community,
offering a scalable and reliable solution for comprehensive
bioinformatics analysis in both academic and clinical settings.
