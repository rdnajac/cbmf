# Application Note

The exponential increase in sequencing data volume due to technological advancements
demands efficient and scalable bioinformatic solutions.

This repository provides a suite of automated (shell) scripts that
streamline common bioinformatic tasks (quality control, alignment, and report generation)
while ensuring high standards of reproducibility with minimal ongoing maintenance.
